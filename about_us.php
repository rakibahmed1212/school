<h1>About Us</h1>


To ensure a quality educational system comparable to that of schools in Australia, AusIS participates in annual Benchmark Testing which provides data on student educational outcomes. These results are compared to those of similar students in Western Australia. These assessments inform our future planning and shape our whole-school approach to teacher appraisals and educational issues. 
Elementary School: 
Our Early Childhood Education program is an integrated program that is delivered through the Western Australia Curriculum Framework. 
Year 1- 12: 
The Year 1- 12 curriculum is based on the outcomes and standards framework of the School Curriculum and Standards Authority of Western Australia. 
>> The school is also fully endorsed with the Secondary & Higher Secondary Education Board to conduct courses 
>> AusIS is the first overseas school to be affiliated with the prestigious Association of Independent School of Western Australia (AISWA) and is currently working toward full endorsement with AISWA.
